Proposal:

-Create an RNN with 20 fully connected layers, each hidden layer accepting a pair of atoms from a molecule.
-Output layer would have 20 nodes (A total of 20 possible SC for a molecule).
-L2 loss.


Possible Blockages:

-Number of input attributes are very less (~10).
-20+ layers with less attributes will have vanishing gradient problem (possible solution would be to use residual connections).
-Find out the meaning of the field "type" (Krishna to help here).
-Represent the entire data in numerical terms.
